# dayis-today

I was learning about subdomain generation and had a stupid idea... <br>

Can I make a website's subdomain automatically change depending on the day of the week?
- Vercel subdomains *.example.com
- Javascript's getDate() function that displays date based on local time

## How to Visit Site
- Root domain is 'dayis.today'
- The only way to excess the site is by the URL [Inset Current Day].dayis.today
- Example URL for a Monday: "mon.dayis.today"

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
